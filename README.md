# Fractal Parametrization and Clustering

This project aims to find hidden parameters in fractal aggregate geometries by calculating all morphological data of the fractal and implementing DBSCAN algorithm to find clusters where morphologies are similar. The positions of primary particles are read from a .txt file. 

## Proposed Parameters

- Number of free-chains (chains that have an open end)
- Angles made by particle triplets
- Length of the largest chain in the aggregate
- Maximum distance between two particles in the aggregate
- Average free-chain length
- Arc-center distance (the radius of a sphere that passes through or is close to a majority of (70%) particles)
